A dating app Back End

Back-end:
To make the database connection easy to handle, I am using spring. 
Dowload Spring IDE: https://spring.io/tools/sts

This a custom IDE built on top of Eclipse. This makes using the Spring Framework much easier.
Do a maven clean install when you first get the project to install all the dependencies. 

The back-end is built as a REST-api which serves data from the database.
